Launch of My Site
-----
This post marks the launch of my new website.
The previous one was a terrible wordpress monstrosity that I left up for way too long.

This website started as / was inspired by [Lihaoyi's 15 Minute Blog Engine](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/ScalaScriptingandthe15MinuteBlogEngine.html)
Some parts of the [source code](https://github.com/Checkroth/scalablog) are largely untouched from that guide, but this is overall my own thing.

I didn't write a line of HTML or CSS for this page - its all scala and markdown. I just run my `Generator.sc`, and all the pages are freshly generated for every change.
